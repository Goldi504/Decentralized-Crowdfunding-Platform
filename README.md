# Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform is a blockchain-based smart contract system built on Ethereum that enables transparent and trustless fundraising campaigns. Project creators can launch funding campaigns with specific goals and deadlines, while backers can contribute cryptocurrency to support projects they believe in. The platform ensures that funds are only released to project creators when funding goals are met, and provides automatic refunds to contributors if goals are not achieved by the deadline.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize fundraising by eliminating intermediaries and creating a transparent, global platform where innovation can be funded directly by communities. We aim to build trust between project creators and backers through smart contract automation, ensuring that funds are handled fairly and transparently without the need for traditional financial institutions or centralized platforms.
